1. **Incident Status Icons**: I suggest using simple visual icons or symbols to represent the status of incidents on the map. This could include icons for "unresolved," "in progress," or "resolved." These icons would provide crew members with a quick and intuitive way to identify the status of each incident at a glance.

2. **Incident Priority Colors**: I believe it would be beneficial to implement color-coding on the map interface to indicate incident priority levels. For instance, critical incidents could be highlighted in red, while less urgent ones could use green. This visual distinction would help crew members prioritize their response and focus on critical incidents.

3. **Incident Location History Heatmap**: I think it would be a beneficial addition to have a heatmap feature that displays the frequency of incidents in different areas of the park over time. This heatmap could help identify high-incident zones, allowing for proactive management and resource allocation in areas prone to incidents.
